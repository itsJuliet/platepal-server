## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**  
   Begin by cloning this repository:
    https://github.com/itsJuliet/platepal-server

2. Install dependencies
Run the following command to install all required dependencies:

        npm install

3. Create and configure the .env file
In the root directory, create a .env file with the following environment variables:

        DB_HOST=localhost
        DB_USER=your_mysql_user
        DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
        DB_NAME=platepal
        OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
        NODE_ENV=development  
        //'development' will call the mock API for image generation 
        //Use 'production' to use OPEN AI API for real image generation

    Replace the placeholder values with your actual database credentials and OpenAI API key.

## Setup Instructions

You need to create a MySQL database for PlatePal. Once MySQL is set up, run the following commands to create the tables and seed the database:

        npm run db:migrate   
        npm run db:seed     

## Running the App
1. Start the server with:

        npm run dev 

    The server will now be running, and you can access it at http://localhost:8080
